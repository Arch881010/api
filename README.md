# Hello! I have worked on this api

Please feel free *to change this freely*. Data.json will be uploaded to /data${apikey}, which is your apikey that you put into apikey.txt. To start off, start there server from going into main.py and pressing the start button top right. (Open in vs code or figure out how to run it from a command line.) Next run ```npm run main``` in a new terminal. Add more things based on the main.py and mess around with getdata.js.
Please do note, if you leave ```host="0.0.0.0"```, it will run off of your ip. No one can access it on a different ip. Otherwise, for your computer only, remove it.
For the /deliverables/userapikey.txt and /deliverables/apikey.txt. If you were to be fetching data, the "userapikey" is what someone is testing to use the service. If you do not have the proper apikey (userapikey.txt != apikey.txt), it says the url does not exist; which it does not. You can have it set to whatever. As long as they equal each other, it is useable.
