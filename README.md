# Hello! I have worked on this api

Please feel free *to change this freely*. Data.json will be uploaded to /data${apikey}, which is your apikey that you put into apikey.txt. To start off, start there server from going into main.py and pressing the start button top right. (Open in vs code or figure out how to run it from a command line.) Next run ```npm run main``` in a new terminal. Add more things based on the main.py and mess around with getdata.js.
